 ViewController
 
 - beacon configuration (using default estimote uuid/user entered one to select beacon in range)
                        (if we don't do this, then we'll just use the estimote default to range beacons)
 
 - icons for the tab bar?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 LobbyViewController
 
 - readying up
 
 + fix the firebase connection when you leave
 
 + constrain game settings (initial: 20-60, game: 60-900)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 HideAndSeekGameScreen
 
 + remove back button (maybe we should present this modally)
 
 + use the settings chosen in the lobby for the timers
 
 + initial countdown
    tells hiders to run and find a spot to hide
    tells seeker to sit still until the time starts
 
 + detect when a seeker is in close enough proximity to a player
 
 - carry over the leaving functionality to remove people who leave during the game
 
 + end game (go back to lobby)
